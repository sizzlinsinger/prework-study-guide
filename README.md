# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## My motivation was to create a study guide from the pre-work course. I built a webpage that is a place to store my notes on HTML, CSS, git and JavaScript. It makes it easy to store and access my notes from any device with the internet. Throught the project I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how we use git to save all of the different versions of our work.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, review notes from the four different sections. For a suggestion of what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open and there you will see a list of topics we learned along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
